# ETC Mosaic Lua Language Server Addon
This is an addon for the [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/wiki/addons/) for the [ETC Mosaic](https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Architectural-Systems/Mosaic/) architectural lighting system (formerly Pharos Architectural Controls). This addon will provide API definitions and type hints when writing custom trigger action script and IO modules in VSCode, which can then be copied into Mosaic Designer 2.

This addon has been developed for [v10 of the ETC Mosaic Lua API](https://etc-mosaic-controller-api.readthedocs.io/en/v10/lua-api/), and [v2.6 of the IO Module API](https://etc-mosaic-io-module-developer-guide.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6/).
